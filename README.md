In the MainActivity you can change the no of Columns. 

This project is designed to fulfill Staggered Grid Layout feature introduced in Android. This project is proginally designed on the below mentioned link. I found bugs in the project and tried to fix it by pushing it to github repo but I failed as the developer is not allowed this operation. This project is not supported for the ong time, thus I decided to push in a new repo and support these issues. 
Thanks
